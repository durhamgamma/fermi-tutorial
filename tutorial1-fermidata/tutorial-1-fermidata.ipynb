    "In these tutorials you will be taken through your first Fermi-LAT analysis. \n",

    "* What Fermi data looks like.\n",
    "* What the tools are, and what they do.\n",
    "* The Python interface to the tools.\n",
    "* Using a python package called Fermipy which will automate a lot of this for you.\n",
    "* Some more advanced point source analysis techniques.\n",

In some places this is almost word for word identical (as users of Linux know, if something works, don't change it!). In addition, the absolutely incredible Fermi team at NASA and the University of Delaware (Liz, Julie, Jamie Holder, Jeremy), and also the work of Durham alumni Dr Tom Armstrong and Dr Max Harvey. \n",

    "We can see we have to make a few choices in order to get our data from the server. Lets take a look at what we chose, and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinates\n",
    "The equatorial coordinates simply refer to the right ascension (RA) and declination (DEC) of our target, NGC 1275 If you're unsure on RA and DEC... [you can find some background here](https://starwalk.space/en/news/celestial-coordinates). Note our RA is in degrees (it's simpler this way, trust us!).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use Galactic coordinates for this choice, which is particularly convenient if you're looking at $\\gamma$-ray sources on the Galactic plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Range\n",
    "Fermi launched in 2008, and has spent most of its time observing the whole sky, hence there is now about 16 years of public data available. Generally speaking, the more data we have in our analysis, the more photons we have, and often the better our results will be. That said, with variable sources (such as NGC 1275), source properties change over time, and we must investigate how this happens, but more on that later. For our study here, we have 5 months of data, to save on file space and computation time. You will find that a decade long analysis can take quite a while. The current record for a single analysis is 3 days (at Durham).\n",
    "\n",
    "We define time with Fermi in 3 ways. We have the Gregorian calendar, which is the calendar we use on a day to day basis. We also have the Modified Julian Calendar, which counts days in MJD. Finally, we have Mission Elapsed Time (MET). MET is expresed in seconds since a particular date in 2001, and is the preferred way to express Fermi time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use [NASA's online HEASARC xTime](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Tools/xTime/xTime.pl) tool to convert between dates/times, but in general we should use MET.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at the time range in our Query, we see it runs from 2010-2011, even though we input it in MET. The data query always comes out in Gregorian dates, as well as MET.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy Range\n",
    "\n",
    "Fermi has an effective energy range of 100 MeV to 500 GeV, which is generally referred to as the 'high energy' $\\gamma$-ray band. We say it's an effective energy range, because it does detect photons down to 30 MeV, and up to approximately 1 TeV, although these higher energy photons are extremely rare for a detector the size of the LAT. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we tend to use this 100 MeV to 500 GeV range, this allows us to explore the spectrum of a source to its fullest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search Radius\n",
    "\n",
    "Our search radius corresponds to the size of the area we want to look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a larger (20+ degrees) region of interest (ROI) for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- bright sources near your ROI. This can allow flux from a source outside the ROI to work its way into your model. We'll explore this in detail when we come to likelihood fitting.\n",
    "- working on (or close to) the galactic plane. There are lots of bright sources near here, and the best fit of the interstellar emission model will come from a large ROI.\n",
    "- working with sources that peak towards lower energies. The point spread function (PSF) of the *Fermi-LAT* is **very** energy dependent. Its 68% containment region goes from several degrees at 100 MeV to 0.1 degrees at energies > 1 GeV. This can be rather frustrating to deal with, and is the principle reason we use likelihood fitting techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "And a smaller (10 - 20 degrees) ROI if\n",
    "\n",
    "- you're working on an AGN off the plane, without anything bright nearby.\n",
    "- you're working at high energies (>1 GeV). The *Fermi* PSF allows you to cut down your ROI in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does our data look like?\n",

    "If we take a look in the data directory, there are a few files:\n"

    "Everything looks good, apart from our time range! Although we have requested a relatively small amount of data (not even half a year!), the fermi data file server split this into files of different, smaller, and more manageable sizes. The reason for choosing 5 months of data is also influenced by the fact that GitHub (where this tutorial and data is stored) has a file size limit. PH00 gives the photons from roughly the first three months of observations, which is correct. Another curiosity is that of our telescope name: GLAST. GLAST stands for Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope, which is what Fermi was called during its design and construction. There are references to this previous name throughout the software and data: the Fermi tools all begin with 'gt' which stands for GLAST tools. \n",
