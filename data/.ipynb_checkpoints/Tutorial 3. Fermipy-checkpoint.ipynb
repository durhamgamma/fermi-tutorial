    "There is a tool named Fermipy which was developed (mainly) by Matt Wood at NASA Goddard with the help of several others. It's very good at simplifying the whole Fermi analysis chain - as I will demonstrate shortly. \n",

    "\n",
    "Fermipy takes a configuration file in the yaml format (Yaml Ain't Markup Language), and then uses this to run the whole analysis chain along with optimized fitting routines and several other bells and whistles to make your analysis **significantly** easier. Firstly let's have a look at the default config, which has all of the different possible parameters in it for your perusal."
